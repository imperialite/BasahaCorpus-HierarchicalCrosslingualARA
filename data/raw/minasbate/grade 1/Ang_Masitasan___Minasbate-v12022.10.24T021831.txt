Ang Masitasan





Usad na adlaw, May buyog, kalibangbang kag tiwtiw na nagalupad-lupad sa masitasan.





Naglupad an buyog, kalibangbang kag an tiwtiw pakadto sa Mirasol.





Masadya na nagalupad pakadto sa blue ternate an buyog, kalibangbang kag tiwtiw.





Kadi na kag aton puduon an mga burak. Sabi san buyog.





Hilig ko lapitan an mga Mirasol. Sabi san buyog.





Hilig ko lapitan an mga rosas. Sabi san kalibangbang.





Mahilig ako sa blue ternate. Sabi san tiwtiw.





Mahilig ako sa blue ternate. Sabi san tiwtiw.





Nagsabi an buyog, kalibangbang kag tiwtiw, mabalik kami didi uruadlaw.
