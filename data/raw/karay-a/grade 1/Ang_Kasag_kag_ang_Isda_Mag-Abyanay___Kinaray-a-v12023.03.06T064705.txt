Ang Kasag kag ang Isda Mag-Abyanay





Ang Kasag kag ang isda mag abyanay.





Ang Kasag may darwa ka maanyag nga mga mata.





Ang Isda may mala-tinidor nga ikog.





Ang Kasag may duro nga mga kamuy.





Ang Isda warat mga kamuy.





Nagapatakilid magpanaw ang Kasag.





Ginahulag kang Isda ang ana ikog pawala kag patuo para makalangoy.





Naglangoy paagto sa Kasag ang Isda.





Malipayon sanda nga nagasipal.





Uyon nanda maglagaw-lagaw sa kadagatan.
