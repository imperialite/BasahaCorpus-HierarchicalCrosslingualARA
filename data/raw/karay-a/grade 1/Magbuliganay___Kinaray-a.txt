Magbuliganay





Sangka aga, ang magbugto nga sanday Vanh kag Deng nagpamat-ud nga mangahoy kang garatong sa taramnan.





Sa pag-abot nanda sa taramnan, hambal ni Vanh: "Sipak kita, agud duro ang atun mabuul nga garatong."





Isarahanun nga nangahoy si Vanh. Samtang si Deng nagadalagan, nagasipal-sipal kag nagturog sa idalum kang kahoy.





Dasig nga nagapanaw si Vanh, nagatipon kag nagahakwat kang garatong.





Nahulog ni Vanh ang garatong sa lupa kag nabugtawan si Deng.





Nagbugtaw si Deng kag ginbuligan si Vanh sa pagtipon kang garatong.





Hambal ni Deng: "Kung mabuta kang garatong ang sako, buliganay kita sa paghakwat."





Kang kada sara kananda may buta nga sako kang garatong, ginbuligan nanda yayong ang kahoy pauli.
