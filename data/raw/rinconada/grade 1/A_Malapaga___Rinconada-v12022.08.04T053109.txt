A Malapaga


Komar Rien Komar Cheh





Makalulupad a malapaga.





Diri makalalangoy a malapaga.





Nakapagtutuka a malapaga.





Pero diri iya nakakakaon.





Makapag-aagi malapaga.





Alagad diri makakak amang a malapaga.





Makatutugpa sa sanga kin kawoy a malapaga.





Makatutugpa sa sanga kin kawoy a malapaga.
