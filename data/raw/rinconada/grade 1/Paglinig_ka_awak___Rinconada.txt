Nay, nay. Nagtatangis a igin.





Agko Ati a Mata Niya. Limpyan ko Muna.





Maati a ngungo Niya. Limpyan ko man.





Maati a urong Niya. Limpyan ko man.





Maati a talinga Niya. Kaipuwan man limpyan.





Maati a siko Niya. Limpyan ko Naman.





A kamot Niya maati man. Limpyan Naman.





Maati man a ita Niya. Kaipuwan man limpyan.

Tinabangan ko si nanay na ugasan su lubot ku igin.
