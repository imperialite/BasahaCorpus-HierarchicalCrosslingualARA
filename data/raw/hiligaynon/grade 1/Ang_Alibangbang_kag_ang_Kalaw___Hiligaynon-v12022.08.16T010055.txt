Ang Alibangbang kag ang Kalaw


Komar Rien Komar Cheh




Sin Thuokna





Ang alibangbang mas gamay kay sa labog-labog.





Ang labog-labog mas gamay kay sa maya.





Ang maya mas gamay kay sa pikoy.





Ang pikoy mas gamay kay sa bukaw.





Ang kalaw ang pinakadaku.





Ang alibangbang ang pinakagamay.





Makalupad sila tanan.
