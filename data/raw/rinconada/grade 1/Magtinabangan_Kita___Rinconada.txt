Usad na aldow a mag ngod na si Ipin saka Upin naisipan na magtipon sa igagatong.





Pag-abot ninda sa natad, sabi ni Ipin."Magsuwayan kita marig dakol a matipon tang igagatong."





Si Ipin man sana a nagpupurot sa igagatong. Habang si Upin sigi sana a ngayamon saka turog sa irarom ka kawoy.





Labo labong nag-aagi si Ipin saka nagtipon na sa igagatong.





Biglang nabiliwan ni Ipin so mga igagatong, napagmata si Upin.





Napagmata si Upin saka tinabangan si Ipin na magpurot ko mga igagatong.





Sabi ni Ipin:" Pag puno na a butangan kin mga igagatong, magtabang kita sa pagbitbit.





Ko napuno na ninda so kandang butangan. Nagtabang so mag ngod sa pagbitbit ko mga igagatong pauli sa kandang baloy.
