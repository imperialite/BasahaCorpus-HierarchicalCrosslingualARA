Ang Amon Pamilya


Komar Rien Komar Cheh




Chan Pisey





Madamo kami sang hilikuton subong nga adlaw. Tanan gusto magbulig.





Nagahanda sang pagkaon si Nanay.





Nagapahabok sang mga balloon si Tatay.





Nagabulig sa pagpahabok sang mga balloon si Manong.





Nagapreparar sang bayu si Lola.





Nagapuni sang bisikleta si Lolo.





Nagadala sang mga regalo si Tito.





Subong ang kaadlawan ni Manang. Daw ano katahum nga selebrasyon!
