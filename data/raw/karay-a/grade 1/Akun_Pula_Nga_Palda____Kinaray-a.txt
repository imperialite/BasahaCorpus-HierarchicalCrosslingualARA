Akun Pula Nga Palda





"Tiun dun mag-ilis," kuon kang tatay kang babaye. "Kinahanglan ko may inugsuksok," sabat kang babaye.





"Aah! Amo diya ang manunudlo ko nga uniporme."





"Amo diya ang pulis ko nga uniporme."





"Wow! Amo diya ang suldado ko nga uniporme."





"Amo diya ang nars ukon doktor ko nga uniporme."





"Amo diya ang Bombero ko nga uniporme."





"Amo diya ang akun mga pang-eskuwela."





“Boo-hoo-hoo! Sa diin ang akun pula nga palda?”





“Rugya ang pula mo nga palda," kuon kang bugto nga laki kang babaye.





“Nakailis run ako kag handa magguwa."
